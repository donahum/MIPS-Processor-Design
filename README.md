# MIPS-Processor-Design
ECE437 Labs

This is the repository for my ECE437 design labs.  This course iterates through the following designs for processors:
1) Single-cycle
2) 5 Stage Pipeline
3) Caches
4) Multi-core

All designs are tested with simulated memory latency, in simulation, synthesis, and on an Altera FPGA.  The course staff provides some test files that you can compare with a simulator to view which instructions should've been executed, and what you've written to memory.
